# High-level description

In part 3 of our project, we developed a web application to utilize the database we created in previous parts. The database structures are university, which includes people entities like teachers, students, and administrators, and institutional entities like courses and student organizations. Our implementation satisfied all descriptions in our original proposal. 

* Search
  * Users may find every teacher's personal information, the course he/she is teaching, and the rating of the class by teacher's name or department.
  * Users may find information of any class by its class id or the place where it's held.
  * Users may find all personal, academic, and activity information by student's name or major.
  
* Static pages
  * We created a roster page in which we listed every person in our database. The roster is divided on a departmental basis. People in each department are sorted based on their identity.
  * Learning how to survive in college is vital, so we listed 10 professors who have the highest rating.
  * We admire those who are good at surviving in college. So we listed 10 students who receive the highest GPA.
  
* Interesting part
  * One thing that we find very interesting during programming was to locate an entry on two different levels. For example, one can locate a class either from its name or from its location. We use the if/or syntax to do so.
  * Another interesting thing is to incorporate data from different tables into one output table.
